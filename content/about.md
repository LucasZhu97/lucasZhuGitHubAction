Hello there, I'm Rui ([Lucas](/post/lucas)) Zhu [`u+9510`](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=9510) [`u+6731`](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=6731), and you are?

I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), and I'll be rejoining [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) as a Software Development Engineer in Spring 2023 after interning at AWS Transit Gateway. I graduated from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) with a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering. Previsouly, I was advised by Prof. [Yang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.7564/), studying on database systems performance, our work was accepted by [VLDB 22](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol16-volume-info/). I was a Technical Intern building internal tools related to [Coverity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverity), a leading static analysis tool, at [Synopsys, Inc](https://www.synopsys.com/). My primary research interests lie in the broad fields of Computer Systems.
