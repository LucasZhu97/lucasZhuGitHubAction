I quit Chinese socail networking sites a long time ago because I selfishly thought the negative effects of using SNS like Weibo outweighed happiness and well-being it brought me. However, expectedly, some major events pop up on my timeline on the other platforms I use and follow because I still want to have a tether, a connection to the people who raised me, who I trust and love. Recently, I saw a helpless little girl in Chengdu sitting on the ground without being accompanied by her parent, holding a bag of instant noodles during quaratine. I wish I had never seen that photo, but here I am. I know there certainly is a place in hell for people who caused and braindeadly supported and justified this. To this day, I still don't know what exactly happened in [Tangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Tangshan_restaurant_attack), all the words I have seen are woven into a narrative so terrifying that I dare not click on any of the related videos. I wouldn't even care what really happened. Why do I even need to know what exactly happened? Why are these people so obsessed with the "truth" from the offical in a place where there is no free press? Aren't these things powerful and heartbreaking enough to speak for themselves?
